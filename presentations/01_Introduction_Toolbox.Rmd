## Embarking in Data Science

# Why do statistical programming?

## Complete reproducibility and flexibility

- Keeping an exact log of all your mouse clicks in Excel may be problematic...
- Redoing an analysis with adjustments is easy
- Store the analysis, not its output

# The R toolbox

## Overview

This presentation will introduce you to a toolbox that will serve you well during your data quests.  

- The R programming language
- The R studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- R Markdown as documenting and reporting tool
- swirl as training environment


## Tool 1: R itself

## The R programming language


Besides its free nature, R is very popular because it  

- has an interactive mode (read–evaluate–print loop: REPL)
- makes repeating analyses (with new data) very easy
- supports "literate programming" for creating presentations (such as this one!) and reports
- has embedded advanced graphical support


## R graphics showcase

Below follow some figures that you will be able to make at the end of this smester

## Tool 3: RMarkdown

## RMarkdown is a great reporting tool

In RMarkdown, you can combine regular text and figures with embedded R code that will be executed to generate a final document.

You can use it to  

- create reports in word, pdf or html (web)
- create presentations (such as this one)
- create entire websites (as the next course shows)


## RMarkdown is really basic

## Tool 4: swirl

## swirl 

- Swirl is a very nice tool to train your R brain  
- It is a framework for interactive lessons in R 
- I recommend doing those!
